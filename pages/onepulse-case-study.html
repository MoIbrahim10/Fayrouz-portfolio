        <div class="flex-column gap-24">
          <p class="paragraph-1">
            The website's current UX weaknesses and technical deficiencies are
            impacting user engagement, lead conversion, and brand perception.
            Here are the key problems detected:
          </p>
          <h5 class="paragraph-1">1. Inaccurate user targeting</h5>
          <p class="subtitle-1">
            The website isnâ€™t clear on the target audience. The goal should be
            to get into users' heads and really understand what they're
            struggling with. This will eventually help them self-identify as
            target audience. Tailoring the website to meet usersâ€™ pain points
            and meet their specific needs should make it more appealing.
          </p>
          <h5 class="paragraph-1">2. Inconsistent traffic</h5>
          <p class="subtitle-1">
            According to Google Analytics, traffic has inclined over the past 3
            months. The traffic curve seems to be inconsistent in terms of
            growth. It shows constant falls and climbs with no specific trends
            or behavior patterns. After eliminating bot traffic, a spike in
            traffic was detected on May 17th, 12th and June 9th due to linkedin
            driven traffic.

          <h5 class="paragraph-1">
            3. Poor conversion rates and ineffective CTAs
          </h5>
          <p class="subtitle-1">
            The current CTA strategy is not effectively converting users into
            leads and customers. Despite high traffic, CTAs at the bottom of
            resource pages are failing to generate significant conversions,
            indicating a need for a more impactful and compelling CTA approach.
          </p>

            src="../images/one-pulse-ineffective-CTAs-o.webp"
            alt="Screenshot of the One Pulse website showing an ineffective 'Soma' CTA that contributes to a lower conversion rate."

            <p class="subtitle-1">
              <span class="info-icon">ðŸ’¡</span>
              These arenâ€™t actual conversions, just users who make it to the
              demo booking page or the resource gate. Gathered, these CTAs lead
              to only 21 clicks from 1,873 page views. This leaves major room
              for improvement in this area.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h5 class="paragraph-1">4. Usability and security issues</h5>
          <p class="subtitle-1">
            The website's Lighthouse performance scorecard highlights subpar
            technical performance, including low scores in accessibility and
            SEO. These issues contribute to slow loading times and detract from
            the overall user experience, potentially impacting search engine
            rankings and traffic. <br /><br />Some usability issues were
            detected through Google's Core Web Vitals standards and HTTPS
            security. These also seem to be compromising the user experience and
            search engine rankings.

          <div class="flex-column gap-24">
            <h5 class="paragraph-1">
              The competitive analysis was conducted by identifying five direct
              and indirect competitors in the insights platform market. Data was
              gathered by exploring competitors' websites and analyzing their
              target audience, conversion strategies, user engagement elements,
              and customer support features. Here's a summary of the key
              findings:
            </h5>
            <ul class="subtitle-1">
              <li>
                Four out of five competitors prominently display client
                testimonials on their websites. This strategy is used to build
                trust and credibility by showcasing positive feedback and
                experiences from satisfied customers.
              </li>
              <li>
                All competitors use live chat features to engage with users in
                real-time, answer their questions, and guide them through the
                sales funnel. This interactive approach can lead to better user
                support and improved conversion rates.
              </li>
              <li>
                Surprisingly, none of the competitors utilize product
                demonstration videos on their websites. Incorporating videos can
                be an opportunity for One Pulse to stand out and effectively
                showcase the platform's features and functionalities.
              </li>
              <li>
                All competitors use high-quality product mockups to introduce
                and highlight their platform's features. These visually
                appealing representations help users understand the platform's
                capabilities more effectively.
              </li>
              <li>
                Four out of five competitors feature pictures of real people on
                their websites, likely to create a sense of authenticity and
                human connection with the audience.
              </li>
              <li>
                The majority of competitors use gated resources such as
                white-papers, case studies, or eBooks to capture user
                information. This strategy helps in lead generation and building
                a database of potential customers.
              </li>

          <h5 class="paragraph-1">Current "Home" template</h5>
          <img
            src="../images/onepulse-current-home.png"
            alt="Screenshot of the current 'Home' template from the One Pulse website."

          />
          <p class="subtitle-1">
            The website's homepage did a pretty good job of introducing how the
            product works and convincing prospects to buy it, but there's always
            room for improvement.<br /><br />

            The images on the website, especially the ones on the homepage, they
            should have a clear purpose and function. Users nowadays expect
            sharp, clear images that look great. Poor quality screenshots can
            really impact the user experience and how they perceive the
            product.<br /><br />

            To really connect with the audience and leave a lasting impression,
            try including different feature snippets that explain how the
            product can be used in various scenarios and how it can benefit
            different businesses. Adding that personal touch can make a big
            difference!
          </p>
          <h5 class="paragraph-1">Current "Product Feature" template</h5>

          />
          <p class="subtitle-1">
            A productâ€™s sales page can make or break a conversion. This is a
            chance to convince visitors to consider the product and hopefully,
            convert.<br /><br />

            A user is on this page if they want to see more of the product and
            understand how it works. This is where you want to use the most
            social proof. Instead of sourceless quotes, use tailored client
            testimonials displaying a company logo and a real photo of clients
            to increase trust and credibility (ideally tied to a case study).<br /><br />

            After listing a set of features, you may want to use a transitional
            CTA that promotes the free trial. I also recommend adding shorter
            snippets where you simply explain how the product works in 3
            straightforward steps, as well as how to get started with one
            pulse.<br /><br />

            Use storytelling to assist visitors in making their purchase
            decision by helping them put themselves in a clientâ€™s shoes and view
            the product from their perspective. Use visuals and simple copy to
            create a narrative that makes a connection between thr product and
            why should prospects use it. Understand why a certain organization
            needs your product and target that pain point to appeal to their
            needs.<br /><br />

            I recommend including more images of real people, with more
            information about how your customers are using the product, and the
            benefits theyâ€™re experiencing from it.

            The blog page should be aimed at providing the users at the top of
            the funnel with the most important information covering any and all
            areas of the service.<br /><br />

            As it stands, the blog template does a good job of providing enough
            educational information that guides visitors from the top to the
            bottom of the funnel.<br /><br />

            This is where prospects would go to see how the product works for
            their specific use case. The purpose of this page is to connect with
            the target audience and help them make a decision.<br /><br />

            Thereâ€™s nothing as powerful as actually speaking to your audience.
            Start by illustrating your prospectsâ€™ problems to convey how well
            you understand their pain points and end by describing how your
            service meets their needs. Because most people would rather explore
            media than read text, remember to extensively use high quality
            mockups and videos of your product.

          <div class="flex-column gap-24">
            <p class="paragraph-1">
              Based on the insights from the data analysis, competitive analysis
              and the current state of the website pages, these are the final UX
              suggestions to enhance the overall user experience and boost
              conversion (It should be noted that the client was originally
              presented with 20+ suggestions):

                    1. Restructure content to reduce information density and
                    create engaging experiences
                  </h5>
                  <p class="subtitle-1">
                    Remember to always disclose only necessary information. For
                    example, if a user works in brand tracking, they do not need
                    to be distracted by the other use case categories. One way
                    to solve this problem is to use interactive tabs to reveal
                    only the essentials. A user can then choose to proceed to
                    dive deeper and learn more about their case of choice.

                  </h5>
                  <p class="subtitle-1">
                    Telling a story rather than simply listing facts is a great
                    way to infuse empathy and create a positive user experience.
                    It doesnâ€™t have to be complex. Use simple words and
                    one-liner content. Make your visitor the main character and
                    narrate the events that they experience before, during and
                    after using your product.

                  <p class="subtitle-1">
                    Human beings are highly visual creatures who are able to
                    process visual information almost instantly. 90% of all
                    information that we perceive and that gets transmitted to
                    our brains is visual. Image quality can truly make or break
                    your user experience and interface. Especially when it comes
                    to introducing your product. Nowadays, high-quality media is
                    a must-have, not an option.

                  <p class="subtitle-1">
                    You already know the value of social proof and how people
                    are more likely to invest in a service that is highly rated
                    - as opposed to one without any social proof. Prospects want
                    to watch other clients with similar backgrounds and pain
                    points discussing their experience with your service. This
                    can be one of the most powerful tools on your belt if you
                    put time and effort into your case studies.

                    Images are crucial whether it is to convey a message, tell a
                    story, or evoke an emotion. Seeing smiling people triggers
                    an automatic response in humans that release pleasurable
                    chemicals in our brain, like dopamine and serotonin. Adding
                    photos of actual people SMILING and enjoying their
                    experience is a literal hack to making people trust you
                    more.

                  <p class="subtitle-1">
                    Our brains find comfort in familiarity. Tell people what to
                    expect out of your call with them. Before getting on a call
                    with you, your prospects need you to tell them about their
                    problem and how you can help them to fix it. Present your
                    process in detail. It may help both parties if you divide
                    the experience into steps. Use pictures and short sentences
                    to familiarize people with the idea of speaking with you.
