        <div class="flex-column gap-24">
          <p class="paragraph-1">
            The challenge lies in designing a consent process that meets the
            requirements of the app while ensuring a seamless and secure user
            experience. It was also challenging to strike a balance between
            legal compliance and user-centricity.
          </p>
          <h5 class="paragraph-1">1. Inability to modify consent choices</h5>
          <p class="subtitle-1">
            The first issue is the lack of flexibility for users to revisit and
            change their consent choices. It was found that there was no clear
            mechanism to revisit and modify consent choices on the spot, which
            may lead to users experiencing a sense of being locked into their
            initial decisions.

              no way to correct it. I felt stuck with my initial decision.”

          <h5 class="paragraph-1">2. Unclear confirmation process</h5>
          <p class="subtitle-1">
            Users need a clear and easily accessible button or interaction that
            confirms their choices. If the confirmation process is ambiguous or
            hidden within the interface.

            Users feel like they require additional context, explanations, or
            details about the implications of their consent choices to be able

              We unearthed useful insights through analyzing usage data and

            </h5>
            <ul class="subtitle-1">
              <li>
                A majority of 61% of users opt for using the mobile app instead
                of the web dashboard to access their banking info.
              </li>
              <li>
                The heat map revealed that users did not interact with the
                important information section. As a result, they were unaware of
                the legal details they were getting themselves into.
              </li>
              <li>
                Based on user interviews, it was found that 2 out of 5 (40%) of
                the users encountered difficulty in accessing the confirmation
                button.
              </li>
              <li>
                During the user research sessions, it was observed that some
                participants exhibited a natural inclination to close any pop
                ups. As a result, they inadvertently closed the consent form and
                became confused about the subsequent steps they needed to take
                in their journey. It was like a major "Uh-oh, now what?" moment
                for them.

              It was vital to me to ensure that all user problems were solved
              suring this phase. I made sure to offer users the ability to
              revisit and change their consent choices at any time using a
              simple back button. I understand that users have the opportunity
              to modify their preferences at any time through settings, but it
              is likely that they are too lazy to do so. It’s simply frustrating
              not being able to change previous choices on the spot.
              <br /><br />To confirm the user's choices, I used a clear and
              easily accessible switch element for yes/no questions. This should
              help condense the appearance of the questions, making them look
              less intimidating. It should prompt users to finish the form
              quicker because they perceive the form as smaller. <br /><br />
              To address the issue with the ambiguity of the legal information,
              as a part of the journey itself, I showed important information in
              a seprate page rather than having it hidden under the CTA.

                This was the first time I got to work alongside a legal team.
                Although it was challenging keeping up with their requests and
                modifications, I appreciate the opportunity to interpret their
                inputs from a UX standpoint and properly integrate them into the
                mobile app.
