            DrHempMe is an e-commerce website that offers a diverse selection of
            CBD products that cater to different needs and preferences of its
            customers and their use cases.<br /><br />

            The main focus of this redesign is to improve the performance of the
            website in terms of conversion rate and sales. By conducting a
            thorough analysis of the website's current state, identifying areas
            of improvement and implementing strategic changes, the goal is to
            increase the number of visitors to the website who actually complete
            a purchase.

        <h2 class="title-3">Problem Statement</h2>
        <div class="flex-column gap-24">
          <h5 class="paragraph-1">1. High bounce rate</h5>
          <p class="subtitle-1">
            The website experiences a high bounce rate, indicating that many
            visitors leave without engaging or converting. This suggests a need
            to improve the website's design, content, and navigation to retain
            visitors and guide them towards desired actions.
          </p>
          <div class="qoute-sec">
            <p class="subtitle-1">
              <span class="info-icon">💡</span>
              These aren’t actual conversions, just users who make it to the
              demo booking page or the resource gate. Gathered, these CTAs lead
              to only 21 clicks from 1,873 page views. This leaves major room
              for improvement in this area.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="qoute-sec">
            <p class="subtitle-1">
              <span class="info-icon">💡</span>
              A high bounce rate combined with a high average session duration
              could mean that visitors are spending a lot of time on the site,
              but not engaging with the content or completing any desired
              actions (converting on a sale). This could indicate that the
              website is providing valuable information, but not effectively
              guiding visitors towards the desired conversion.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h5 class="paragraph-1">2. Little visitor retention</h5>
          <p class="subtitle-1">
            While returning visitors show higher engagement and conversion
            rates, they make up only a small percentage of overall traffic. The
            goal is to convert more new visitors into returning visitors by
            offering incentives, personalized content, and utilizing email
            marketing to stay in touch with visitors.
          </p>

          <h5 class="paragraph-1">
            3. Who's our crowd? (target audience misalignment)
          </h5>
          <p class="subtitle-1">
            he majority of website visitors fall within the 25-44 age range and
            slightly skew male, which seems to be a different crowd than we
            want. Reevaluating marketing strategies is necessary to better reach
            the desired market segment.
          </p>

          <h5 class="paragraph-1">4. Homepage as both landing and exit page</h5>
          <p class="subtitle-1">
            Good & bad news. The homepage is the most popular landing,
            indicating a strong online presence. However, it is also the most
            popular exit page. There may be a lack of clear CTAs and compelling
            content, leading visitors to exit without exploring further.
          </p>
          <h5 class="paragraph-1">5. Checkout page behavior</h5>
          <p class="subtitle-1">
            The behavior flow analysis shows that users are immediately
            redirected to the checkout page after adding products to their
            carts. While this can increase conversions, it may also cause some
            users to leave without completing a purchase. I suggest giving users
            the option to continue shopping so they can take their time and feel
            more in control.

          <div class="flex-column gap-24">
            <p class="paragraph-1">
              The competitive analysis was conducted by identifying two direct
              competitors in the CBD market. Data was gathered by exploring
              competitors' websites and analyzing their target audience,
              conversion strategies, user engagement elements, and customer
              support features. Here's a summary of the key findings:
            </p>
            <h5 class="paragraph-1">1. fabcbd.com</h5>
            <p class="subtitle-1">
              The website showcases a clean and professional design with
              effective social proof through user testimonials and magazine
              logos. They use high-quality product mockups and photos of real
              individuals using their products, enhancing authenticity.<br />
              <br />

              The website employs persuasive language to highlight customer
              benefits and offers intuitive navigation with an advanced mega
              menu. Helpful features like well-organized FAQs, product
              recommendations, and a cost calculator for free shipping enhance
              the user experience.
            </p>

            <h5 class="paragraph-1">2. fivecbd.com</h5>
            <p class="subtitle-1">
              The website impresses with a fun and colorful design, offering
              simple navigation and a personalized experience through an
              interactive quiz. Transparent information about product details
              and ratings builds trust, while grouping products based on use
              cases adds convenience. They also showcase authentic images of
              people using their products. <br /><br />

              However, the website lacks sufficient social proof and real people
              images on the homepage, and the use of low-quality illustrations
              could be improved for larger screens.

        <div class="flex-column gap-24">
          <p class="subtitle-1">
            The main challenge in designing this website was the restriction on
            using certain words like "Sleep," "Medication," and "Anxiety," which
            are crucial in addressing client pain points and making them feel
            seen.<br /><br />

            I had to get creative and think of ways to tackle client problems
            without resorting to those prohibited phrases. Luckily, the business
            had received plenty of glowing reviews from happy customers. I
            thought, why not let those satisfied clients do the talking for us?
            If they mentioned those specific phrases in their testimonials, it
            wouldn't pose any legal issues since it's just a direct quote from
            them. It turned out to be a great workaround for this situation, and
            it felt like a win-win. The business could showcase its
            effectiveness and make customers feel seen, all while staying within
            the legal boundaries.<br /><br />

            I strategically placed these testimonials in prominent spots to
            catch the visitors' attention right away. By showcasing real stories
            of satisfied customers and the benefits they experienced aside their
            real image with the product they’ve used, I was able to create a
            strong sense of trust and credibility for the products.

          <img src="images/onepulse current home.png" alt="" />
          <p class="subtitle-1">
            The website's homepage did a pretty good job of introducing how the
            product works and convincing prospects to buy it, but there's always
            room for improvement.<br /><br />

            The images on the website, especially the ones on the homepage, they
            should have a clear purpose and function. Users nowadays expect
            sharp, clear images that look great. Poor quality screenshots can
            really impact the user experience and how they perceive the
            product.<br /><br />

            To really connect with the audience and leave a lasting impression,
            try including different feature snippets that explain how the
            product can be used in various scenarios and how it can benefit
            different businesses. Adding that personal touch can make a big
            difference!

          <img src="images/drhempmehome.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />
          <p class="subtitle-1">
            I used a conversational tone in the copy to make users feel
            comfortable and at ease while browsing. No walls of text here! I
            kept it concise and easy to read, especially on mobile devices.

            <br /><br />

            I added transitional CTAs throughout the website to guide users to
            relevant information without overwhelming them. I also used VideoAsk
            to add a personal touch and build a connection with potential
            customers. People love to see real faces, right?

          <h2 class="title-3">Checkout Process Redesign</h2>
          <div class="flex-column gap-24 image-container">
            <p class="subtitle-1">
              Before implementing the dynamic sidebar checkout cart, the
              website's checkout process had a critical flaw. Whenever users
              clicked on the “Add to Cart” CTA, they were immediately taken to
              the checkout page without the opportunity to review their cart or
              make any adjustments. some users might have been caught off guard
              or felt rushed, leading to cart abandonment.<br /><br />

              By implementing this dynamic cart, users had more control over
              their shopping experience, and they could easily continue
              exploring other products without losing track of what they
              intended to purchase. <br /><br />

              This improvement reduced friction in the checkout process, making
              it more user-friendly and reduces the likelihood of cart
              abandonment from 60% to 39%!
            </p>
            <img src="images/Drhemp main page.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />
            <p class="subtitle-1">
              I added a progress bar, so customers could see exactly where they
              were in the checkout journey. <br /><br />

              The text on the "Place Order" CTA button was tweaked to something
              more explicit, "Proceed to Payment." This made it clearer for
              customers what the next step in the process would be, reducing
              uncertainty.<br /><br />

              To present upselling opportunities, the cart was also utilized to
              show related products that customers might be interested in based
              on popular or frequently bought-together items.<br /><br />

              And since so many people shop on their phones, I made sure the
              whole process was mobile-friendly.

            <p class="subtitle-1">
              Before the improvements, the menu lacked organization and
              simplicity, making it challenging for users to navigate the
              website efficiently. <br /><br />

              To enhance the menu, a mega menu was implemented for the "Shop"
              label, grouping products by category and making it easier for
              users to browse and find what they needed. <br /><br />

              Two simple and straightforward menus, "Why Fab?" and "Learn," were
              also introduced, providing easy access to essential information
              about the company and its products. <br /><br />

              These changes streamlined the navigation experience and ensured
              users could access important pages with just a few clicks.

        <h2 class="title-3">Mobile Experience Redesign</h2>
        <div class="flex-column gap-24 image-container">
          <p class="subtitle-1">
            Previously, the mobile user experience was subpar, with issues such
            as text overlap and difficulty reading content due to poor contrast.
            <br /><br />

            Text overlap was resolved, ensuring that all content displayed
            correctly on mobile devices. Addressing contrast issues made the
            text and elements easily readable for users with visual impairments.
            <br /><br />

            The dynamic sidebar checkout cart was introduced, making it more
            mobile-friendly and allowing users to view and manage their cart
            without leaving the page they were on. <br /><br />

            The size of interactive elements, such as buttons, was increased to
            accommodate touch interactions. This prevented users from
            accidentally clicking on the wrong item and improved overall
            navigation efficiency.

            • Dealing with those legal restrictions on certain words was tough,
            but it pushed me to think outside the box. Finding alternative ways
            to address client pain points while staying compliant was a real
            challenge that I embraced.<br /><br />

            • Letting real clients talk about their experiences built trust and
            made the website so much more credible.
